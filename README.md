# Password Managers (KeePass)

### Why You Should Use a Password Manager
- You don’t need to remember hundreds of passwords
- You only need to remember one master password
- You can have different passwords for different websites and don't need to worry about forgeting them

#### [Difference between automatic autofill and manual autofill](https://medium.com/@brianrusseldavis/are-autofill-password-managers-safe-8805edf952bf#:~:text=The%20Difference%20Between%20These%20Two%20Types%20of%20Autofill&text=According%20to%20a%20recent%20study,another%20to%20submit%20the%20credentials)
##### Automatic Autofill:
- Does not wait for user interaction
- One click: submit button 
- Vulnerable to vatious sweep attacks
##### Manual Autofill:
- Wait for user interaction 
- Two clicks: select correct account + submit credential 
- More secure 

### Threats, Attacks and Defences
##### [Redirect Sweep Attacks](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/silver)
- Resirect sweep attack is only gainst automatic autofill password managers. When a taget user connect to a wifi hotspot that is controlled by an attacker, the attacker will trick the password manager to fillin the password and send the password back to the attacker.[2]
- Defence:
  - Require user interaction before autofilling 
  - Login page over HTTPS
##### [Cross Site Scripting(XSS) Injection](https://cispa.saarland/group/stock/papers/stock2014protecting.pdf)
- An attacker inject JavaScript code to login page then the program gets credentials and send back to the attacker.[3]
- Defence:
  - Explicit user interaction to trigger fill-in action
  - URL matching and form matching
##### [Other Attacks](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-silver.pdf)
- iFrame sweep attack
- Window sweep attack
- Attack amplification via password sync


### Keepass Password Safe
[download KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
KeePass Password Safe is a free, open sourcem light-weight password manager.[4]
##### Why use Keepass
- Third party tool
- Manual autofill (secure)
- Free and open-source 
- Strong compatibility (it primarily used in Windows devices, but it supports all Operating Systems like Mac, IOS, Android, Linux)[5]
- Lightweight (it wouldn’t occupy many memory of your device)
- Easy to use (it has clear User Interface, so it would be easy-to-manage even for the beginner)
##### How does Keepass work
- The KeePass stores all the passwords in _a database file_, which is locked with _a master key_. [4]
- The database file is encrypted using the _best_ and _most secure_ encryption algorithms, which are __AES__ and __Twofish__.
- KeePass uses __SHA-256__ to hash the master key components.
##### Encryption algorithms
##### [AES](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/04/advanced-encryption-standard-aes-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/)
![alt text][AES] 
- It uses __symmetric block cipher__ (same key for both encryption and decryption)
- It proved to be useful to protect sensitive data
  - __National Security Agency (NSA)__ utilize AES encryption to protect their sensitive information [6]
  - __Many governments and institutions__ are using AES to protect their data [7]
- It __hard to brute force__, since it accepts key sizes more than 128 bits
##### [Twofish](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1998/12/the_twofish_encrypti.html)
![alt text][Twofish] 
- It uses __symmetric block cipher__ (same key for both encryption and decryption)
- It Trade-offs between __key-setup time__ and __encryption speed__ that make it unique among the AES candidates [8]
- There have been a few attacks on Twofish. However, It did __not constitute a true cryptanalysis__ [9], according to its creator, Bruce Schneier.
- It __hard to brute force__. Similar to AES, since the TwoFish supports key sizes of more than 256 bits, it is resistant to brute force attack[10]
##### [SHA-256](https://www.solarwindsmsp.com/blog/sha-256-encryption#:~:text=SHA%2D256%20is%20a%20patented,that%20is%20256%20bits%20long.&text=In%20cryptographic%20hashing%2C%20the%20hashed,its%20original%20512%2Dbit%20form)
![alt text][SHA-256] 
- SHA-256 is a __patented cryptographic hash function__
- It is a __keyless hash function__ that takes information and generates random characters with __length 256 bits__ [11]
- It is almost impossible to reconstruct the initial data from the hash value.
  - A brute-force attack would need to make 2256 attempts to generate the initial data. [12]
- It is unlikely to have two same hash value of two inputs.
  - With 2256 possible hash values, the likelihood of two being the same is infinitesimally, unimaginably small. [12]
- The avalanche effect.
  - A minor change to the original data will make its hash value change a lot. So two similar inputs will not likely generates similar hashed output through AHS-256.
